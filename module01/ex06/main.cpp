/*
** Exercise 06: Harl filter
**
** Turn-in directory: ex06/
** Files to turn in: Makefile, main.cpp, Harl.{h, hpp}, Harl.cpp
** Forbidden functions: None
**
** Description:
** Create a program that filters Harl's messages based on log levels.
** - Takes one of the four levels as a parameter.
** - Displays all messages from the given level and above.
**
** Example:
** $> ./harlFilter "WARNING"
** [ WARNING ]
** I think I deserve to have some extra bacon for free.
** [ ERROR ]
** This is unacceptable! I want to speak to the manager now.
**
** Use the `switch` statement to implement the filtering system.
** Name the executable `harlFilter`.
