/*
** Exercise 02: HI THIS IS BRAIN
**
** Turn-in directory: ex02/
** Files to turn in: Makefile, main.cpp
** Forbidden functions: None
**
** Description:
** Write a program with:
** - A string variable initialized to "HI THIS IS BRAIN".
** - `stringPTR`: a pointer to the string.
** - `stringREF`: a reference to the string.
**
** Print:
** - The memory address of the string variable, `stringPTR`, and `stringREF`.
** - The value of the string variable, the value pointed to by `stringPTR`, and the
**   value referenced by `stringREF`.
**
** Goal: Demystify references and understand their similarities to pointers.
