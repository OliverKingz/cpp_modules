/*
** Exercise 05: Harl 2.0
**
** Turn-in directory: ex05/
** Files to turn in: Makefile, main.cpp, Harl.{h, hpp}, Harl.cpp
** Forbidden functions: None
**
** Description:
** Create a `Harl` class with private member functions:
** - `void debug(void);`
** - `void info(void);`
** - `void warning(void);`
** - `void error(void);`
**
** Add a public member function:
** - `void complain(std::string level);`
**   Calls the appropriate private function based on the level passed.
**
** Use pointers to member functions to avoid a forest of `if/else` statements.
** Test the class with various levels to ensure functionality.
