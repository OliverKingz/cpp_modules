/*
** Exercise 04: Sed is for losers
**
** Turn-in directory: ex04/
** Files to turn in: Makefile, main.cpp, *.cpp, *.{h, hpp}
** Forbidden functions: std::string::replace
**
** Description:
** Create a program that:
** - Takes a filename and two strings, `s1` and `s2`, as parameters.
** - Opens the file `<filename>` and copies its content into `<filename>.replace`,
**   replacing every occurrence of `s1` with `s2`.
**
** Use C++ file manipulation functions and handle unexpected inputs and errors.
** Test the program thoroughly to ensure correctness.
